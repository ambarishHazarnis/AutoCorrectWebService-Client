AutoCorrect Client-

This is a client program that uses the “autocorrect” Web service. 
The client: 
1. Reads from an formatted input file “news.txt” 
2. Parses the file and corrects all spelling errors in the file using the 
“autocorrect” web service 
3. Outputs results with corrected spellings to a new file “corrected.txt” 
 
Here is the format of the file “news.txt”. In this file, each line is a clip of news and has the 
following format: 
 
MM/DD/YYYY [NEWS_TITLE] NEWS_CONTENT

AutoCorrectWebService-Client
============================

Following the SOA architecture, a local autocorrect web service is provided which automatically corrects erroneous spellings. 
A client is also implemented which uses this web service. 


To implement this a remote Spell Checker Web service (http://wsf.cdyne.com/SpellChecker/check.asmx?wsdl) is used. 
This Web service finds wrong spellings and provides suggestions for replacement.
